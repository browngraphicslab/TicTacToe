# Tic Tac Toe

# CODE

Hello! These files are here to offer you a couple different resources. The directory ./src/client/solution contains two different
well-commented solution files to give you a complete walkthrough of one implementation of Tic Tac Toe. However, if you want to try it out on your own first, edit any and all of the files in ./src/client/stencil (with outlines, imports and some function signatures already in place) to write your own implementation!

 # Run the solutions:
Run 'npm run make' in the command line from the root folder of the project and go to http://localhost:1050/tic-tac-toe for the standard solution, or http://localhost:1050/tic-tac-toe/stateful for the slightly more complex version that talks to the server to store information across page refreshes.

# Run your implementation:
run 'npm run make' in the command line from the root folder of the project and go to http://localhost:1050/tic-tac-toe/stateful. 

Once you're super familiar with those, you can
consider exploring the rest of the code base. Note that a lot of the configuration
files in the root directory are not important to know at this point, but if you have the time,
you're encouraged to get to know them on your own or to ask one of the team leads.

Here's a high level overview of the project's internal structure:

# GAME

After cloning the repository, from the project root directory, run:

npm install && npm run make

Open up the browser, go to http://localhost:1050 and start playing!

Instructions: Left click to place an X, and right click to place an O.

# EXTENSIONS

If you're looking for a challenge, try forking the repository for yourself and implementing:
1) Undo / redo of moves
2) Highlighting the winning row / column / diagonal
