Get off the ground in minutes with a light weight, flexible and fully configured NodeJS server that serves transpiled TypeScript / React code for its client.

After cloning the repository, from the project root directory, run:

npm install && npm run make

Open up the browser, go to http://localhost:1050 and start playing!

NOTE: Left click to place an X, and right click to place an O.

If you're looking for a challenge, try implementing:
1) Undo / redo of moves
2) Highlighting the winning row / column / diagonal
