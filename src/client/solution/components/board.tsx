/**
 * One of the issues with plain JavaScript objects is that they can literally
 * hold anything. This is flexible, but it can be hard to know what to expect
 * when you're given an object without context, and can make it a lot easier
 * to accidentally pass in the wrong type (string[] vs string, for example).
 * 
 * Interfaces to the rescue!
 * 
 * These types are just contracts that say, hey, if you're an object of this type,
 * you should expect me to have the following keys that map to the values of the given
 * type. This is a simple example. You can define more generic interfaces, and then use
 * one in the definition of the other!
 * 
 * // defines a generic interface
 * interface DataValue<T> {
 *     value: T;
 *     modifiedTime: number;
 *     id: string;
 * }
 * 
 * // uses the generic interface in the definition of another generic interface
 * interface DataDictionary<T> {
 *     [key: string]: DataValue<T>
 * }
 * 
 * // and you can use it as follows...
 * const dictionary: DataDictionary<string> = {}
 * const id = "1234-5678-9102";
 * const datum: DataElement<string> = {
 *     value: "Hello World!",
 *     modifiedTime: Date.now(),
 *     id
 * }
 * dictionary[id] = datum;
 * 
 * ...
 * 
 * const retrieved = dictionary[id]
 * console.log(retrieved.value) // outputs Hello World! 
 * 
 * Take a look here for all the cool interfaces you can define!
 * https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html
 * 
 * Here, an interface is used to specify what types of properties
 * the component should expect to receive, and thus what the parent needs
 * to provide.
